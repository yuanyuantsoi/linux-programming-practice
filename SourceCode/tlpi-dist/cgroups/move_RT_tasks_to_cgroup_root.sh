# Move all realtime (RT) tasks in the cgroups version 2 unified hierarchy
# to the cgroup root directory. This can be useful because, before Linux 5.4,
# it was not possible to enable the "cpu" controller if there were RT tasks in
# nonroot cgroups.  This restriction was in place because the cgroups v2
# "cpu" controller did not yet understand how to handle RT tasks.
#
# This script must be run as superuser.
#
# The script by default assumes that the cgroup v2 hierarchy is mounted at
# /sys/fs/cgroup. If the hierarchy is mounted elsewhere, then that location
# should be specified as the (sole) command-line argument to the script.
