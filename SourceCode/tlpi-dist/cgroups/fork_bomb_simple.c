/* fork_bomb_simple.c

   A simple fork-bomb program that can be useful when experimenting with
   the cgroups 'pids' controller.

   The program creates as many children as possible. Each child sleeps for
   60 seconds, as does the parent when it can create no more children.

main(int argc, char *argv[])

    printf("Parent PID = %ld\n", (long) getpid());

    for (int j = 1; ; j++) {
        pid_t childPid = fork();

        if (childPid == 0)      /* Child falls out of loop */
            break;
